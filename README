To run:
	1)Run command "make"
	2)Run the executable with the command "./scanner"
	3)To run a file through it, create a file (ex. text.txt)
		i) Use command: "./scanner < text.txt"
	4)Use "make clean" to clean up directory




Part 1:
Your first project is to build a scanner for a subset of Turing. You are to
use lex (or write equivalent code) for the scanner. The productions for the
constructs that I will have you work with are on the attached sheet. The
tokens are:
• The class of Identifiers: a case-sensitive sequence of letters, digits and
underscores that start with a letter (not an underscore).
• The class of Integers (without leading signs)
• The class of Real Constants (both ’Int . Int’ and ’Int . Int* Exponent’)
• Any of the Reserved Words, all of which are in lower case: var, int,
real, boolean, record, end, bind, to, assert, begin, loop, exit,
when, if, then, elsif, else, put, or, and, not, not=, div, mod
• Any of the operators ; : := < > = <= >= + - * / . , ( )
You will also need to write a tester program that reads stdin, separates out
the tokens, and writes the token number and the string representing the
token to stdout.
